/*
 * lightningGenerator.js — procedural lightning artwork, generated off the main
 * thread and transferred as an ImageBitmap.
 *
 * There is one kind of artwork: a cloud-to-ground bolt. One dominant channel
 * grows downward with the classic dendritic forks, drawn the way the original app
 * drew it - one heading, step, kick, pull back toward vertical, and a 9 pixel
 * channel on a 2500 x 5000 tile (see CG_SHAPE and ARTWORK_SIZE).
 *
 * Every strike uses it. Intra-cloud flashes used to be a separate network of
 * hair-thin filaments, drawn from eight artwork tiles through their own additive
 * light pass; they are drawn with this bolt now, at this bright, and the filament
 * artwork is gone with the pass that used it (see realisticDisplayShader.frag).
 *
 * Protocol:
 *   worker.postMessage({width, height})  -> bolt bitmap
 * The worker always posts back the ImageBitmap itself.

/*
 * One step of a channel's heading.
 *
 * The heading is turned by a *curvature*, and the curvature drifts slowly
 * toward a target that itself wanders. Two levels of noise, not one, is what
 * makes a strand look like a hair instead of either a straight line or a
 * spring: over the length of a strand the target gives it a handful of arcs of
 * different radius, while the fast response keeps the path smooth between them.
 * A single random walk of the curvature - the obvious first attempt - has the
 * heading wander so far over a long strand that every channel coils into a
 * loop and the flash turns into a ball of wool.
 *
 * Every now and then a real kink is applied straight to the heading, which is
 * the one thing a channel of ionised air does that a hair does not.
 *
 * A strand that leaves its charge layer is turned back by bending its target
 * curvature (never by snapping its heading), so the fine curl survives the turn
 * instead of being flattened into a run along the edge.
 *
 * `s` is the per-filament state ({axis, curv, curvTarget}); `rand` is passed in
 * rather than closed over so a test can drive the heading deterministically.

/* ===================== cloud-to-ground bolt ============================== */

/*
 * The shape of a cloud-to-ground channel: the original one, unchanged.
 *
 * One heading, turned every step by its own noise (`(rand - 0.5) * 1.4`, up to
 * +-40 degrees a pixel) and pulled back toward straight down by 8% a step. The
 * result is a channel that buzzes down the picture: high-frequency kinks with no
 * long arc to them, which is what makes it read as a return stroke rather than as
 * a filament.
 *
 * This is the artwork the app shipped with, and it is where it stays: the shapes
 * and widths tried on top of it (a two-scale heading, a hair-thin channel) were
 * taken back out when the look was restored. The numbers are the original ones -
 * 9 artwork pixels for the trunk, half of that at most for a fork, and a fork that
 * sheds a fifth of a pixel every time it narrows - and they are named here only so
 * tests/check-lightning-bolt.js can hold them.
 *
 * The tile is the original one too: 2500 by 5000. This repo's fork of the app had
 * halved both the tile and the channel (1250 x 2500, 4.5 pixels) and doubled the
 * brightness gain to compensate, which keeps the relative width but throws away
 * half the texels - the channel is softer and breaks up sooner when the camera
 * pulls back. The radiance is unchanged by the rescale: pow(lineWidth, 2) is 81
 * for the trunk either way.
 *
 * Numbers are in artwork pixels per step; a step is one pixel.
